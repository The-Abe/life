A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life built with C++ and raylib.

## Description

This project is a visual implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular
automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game consists of a grid of
cells that evolve over time based on simple rules, creating complex and
interesting patterns.

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Running

After building, run the executable from the build directory:

```bash
./life
```

## Dependencies
